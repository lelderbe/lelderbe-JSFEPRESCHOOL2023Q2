                An unusual sci-fi story about a book eater woman who tries desperately to save her
                dangerous
                mind-eater son from tradition and certain death. Complete with dysfunctional family
                values,
                light Sapphic romance, and a strong, complex protagonist. Not for the faint of
                heart.

                Auerbach's engaging book places the 'Comedy' within the tradition of epic, tragedy,
                and
                philosophy in general, arguing for Dante's uniqueness as one who raised the
                individual
                and
                his drama of soul into something of divine significance—an inspired introduction to
                Dante's
                main themes.
